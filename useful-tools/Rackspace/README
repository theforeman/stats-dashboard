# Rackspace Cost summarizer

This script loads in the CSV format invoices from Rackspace, and outputs data
regarding the recent usage. All data is loaded, so it can be queried if
comparisons to older months are required.

# Requirements

R packages: tidyverse, knitr, forcats, lubridate
Data: the CSV invoices from Rackspace, or the backups on debugs.theforeman.org

# Example run

$ cp /tmp/invoices/*csv original-csv-files/.
$ R

> source('./graph-costs.R')

(A graph window will open)

# Notes

The `costs` data frame will contain all the summed costs, which can be queried
if need be. For other ways to slice the data, look in `rackspace-calc.R` for
how the data is loaded and summarised.
